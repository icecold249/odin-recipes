# odin-recipes
This project is my first step into web development. It’s a simple recipes website built to practice and demonstrate what I’ve learned about basic HTML.

The early versions may look very minimal since I haven’t added CSS yet. As I continue learning, especially once I study CSS, I plan to improve the layout, styling, and overall user experience.
