    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Steak pizzaiola, or <i>carne alla pizzaiola</i>, is a classic, rustic Neapolitan dish that features thinly cut steak braised in a flavorful tomato sauce seasoned with garlic and oregano. The name literally means "pizza-maker style meat," referring to the simple, traditional ingredients used in a basic pizza marinara sauce.</p>

            <li>Season steaks with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.  Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large deep skillet over high heat. Add steaks to skillet and cook, undisturbed, until browned about 2 minutes.  Flip and cook 1 more minute. Remove steaks from skillet and set aside.</li>
            <li>Add remaining oil to skillet and turn heat to medium.  Add onions, remaining salt and pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally until softened.  Add garlic and cook for 1 minute.
