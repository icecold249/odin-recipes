    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>A <b>grilled cheese</b>, <b>toasted cheese sandwich</b>, <b>cheese toastie</b> (UK) or <b>jaffle</b> (AU) is a hot cheese sandwich typically prepared by placing cheese between slices of bread and cooking with butter or mayonnaise on a frying pan, griddle, or sandwich toaster, until the bread browns and the cheese melts. Despite its name, it is rarely prepared through grilling.</p>
    <h2>How to Make Grilled Cheese</h2>
    <p>You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:</p>
    <h3>Grilled Cheese Ingredients</h3>
    <p>This classic grilled cheese sandwich recipe calls for just white bread, sliced cheese, and butter. It's easy to switch up the bread and cheese to suit your taste preferences and, if you like, you can substitute mayonnaise for butter.</p>
    <h3>Best Cheese for Grilled Cheese</h3>
    <p>This recipe calls for sliced Cheddar, which is a wonderfully crowd-pleasing cheese. You can use sharp Cheddar, mild Cheddar, or a blend of both. Another classic choice is plain ol' sliced American cheese – it tastes nostalgic and gives you a gorgeous cheese pull.</p>
    <p>Other delicious options are Gruyere, Brie, Fontina, Gouda, Pepper Jack, and havarti.</p>
    <h3>Best Bread for Grilled Cheese</h3>
    <p>This recipe calls for plain white sandwich bread. You could also use sourdough, brioche, or even ciabatta. You can really make grilled cheese with any type of bread you like, but you should make sure the loaf is sturdy enough to handle the heat. Thinly sliced, delicate breads will quickly fall apart.</p>
    <h3>How to Make the Best Grilled Cheese</h3>
    <p>Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make this grilled cheese sandwich recipe:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Butter the bread on one side and place the bread butter-side down on a hot skillet.</li>
            <li>Top with cheese, then place another slice of bread on top (butter-side up).</li>
            <li>Cook until the bottom slice is lightly browned, then flip.</li>
            <li>Continue cooking until the cheese is melted.</li>
        </ol>
